this is to dump calendar events to discord

the configuration is customized at the bottom of the file.
- set the calendar list
- set the discord webhooks
- set the public URL for the calendar


this can also make multiple posts to discord, but keep in mind that there is a limit to how many channels you can post in at once from a single script
